This Capstone Project is Case Study of Online Payments Fraud Detection.

Problem Definiton: Blossom Bank as a multinational financial service group needs to have the capacity to predict fraud and terminate fraudulent transactions.
Solution: Build a machine learning model to predict online payment fraud

Steps Outline:
1. Data Loading and Inspection
  - Load the data
  - Get summary and statistics of the data
  - Check for Nulls
  - Explore Correlations
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
  - Explore correlation
  - Univariate Analysis
  - Bivariate Analysis
  - Data Imbalance
3. Machine Learning Modelling on Original, Imbalanced Data
  - Check the Data for Imbalance
  - Model Selection, Training, and Validation
  - Perform Feature Engineering
  - Model with top 5 important features
4.  Machine Learning Modelling with Stratified and Rescaled Dataset
  - Handle Imbalance and Outliers in the dataset
  - Label Encoding
  - Train and Test on Stratified Dataset
  - Scaling the data
  - Model the data using re-scaled dataset
 5. Machine Learning Modelling with Stratified, Rescaled & Resampled Dataset
  - Handle imbalance through combination of Oversampling & Undersampling using Robust Normalized Dataset
  - Model the data based on Robust-Normalized Dat and different types of Resampling
 6. Result Interpretation
 7. Summary
